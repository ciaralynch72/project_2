# Oh, Canada! #
For my second milestone project I have came up with an idea to create a fun and informative quiz about Canada. Canada is quite often overshadowed by it's neighbor to the south so I wanted to create a quiz that hightlights what an amazing country Canada is. 


### Site owner's goals ###
To create a fun and engaging quiz using html, css and vanilla javascript that will allow a player to answer a series of questions and get their score at the end. 
To do this I plan to implement the following features:
- An input field for the player
- A score tracking system
- A series of questions and possible answers
- Upon submitting an answer the player will be told if they answerwed correctly or incorrectly and given a factual information about the correct answer
- A submission form where they can submit their own facts about Canada 

### External user goals ###
To be able to play a quiz that will test their knowledge on Canada and to be able to know how well they did and hopefully learn some new facts about Canada

## UX ##

### Strategy ### 
This site will be used by those interesed in testing their knowledge on Canada and hopefully learning some new fun and interesting facts as they progress along throught the quiz. 

#### Target Audience ####
- Anyone aged 8 and up that has an general interest in Canada
- People looking to expand their knowledge of Canada
- People who enjoy quizes 

#### Features required ####
- A start quiz button
- Quiz questions and possible answers
- A next/previous and restart quiz button
- Score tally at the end of the quiz

The website needs to be intuitive and easy to navigate for the user. Users need to get a sense of accomplishment when they finish and know how well they have done. The site is responsive to all many screens so the user can enjoy the quiz anywhere. 


### Scope ###
To deliver a site to meet user needs I will need to have to following features in place:
- A home screen with a start button
- Quiz questions 
- 

### Structure ###

This will be a simple website where the user will be presented with some general information on the quiz and the abilty to input their name and then press the 'Start quiz' button that will lead them through a series of questions testing their general knowlege of Canada and informing them of facts about each correct answer.

The site will be easy to navigate and intuitive to all the user to have a pleasant experience.

-  [Web Home](docs/readme_images/web_wireframe_question.GIF)
-  [Web Home](docs/readme_images/web_wireframe_answer.GIF)

The wireframes were created as a base for this project to help me get a concrete visual of what I wanted and needed to build for this project. It will be a reference point thoughout and it will help me visualize what I need to create in my html, css and js documents 

### Surface ###

I have chosen colors that are found all across the Canadian landscape and will resonate with anyone who has seen photos of Canada.

I have chosen Open Sans and Libre Bakersville fonts as similar fonts are used for the offical Canada wordmarks so I feel they will resonate with the site user.
